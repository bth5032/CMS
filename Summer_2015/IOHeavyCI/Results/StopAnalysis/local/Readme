Run 1 -- Tried to naively change the location of the files in the code to in /data3/xrootd/SABM. However, many errors seem to have been thrown. It seems like the 
	 program attempts to find the sample files on the submitting machine before they are submitted to condor. For me that was UAF-4, which of course does not
	 have the files on there.
