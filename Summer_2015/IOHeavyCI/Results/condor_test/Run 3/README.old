This run is the same as run 2, but we're simply echoing the commands 
that should be run on the remote machines instead of trying to run them in
order to test whether the scripts are being run. In Run 2, nothing was output
to the output files from the "reader" program. I am curious as to whether 
standard output isn't what gets output to "out.*" or whether if you
have another program that has output whether there is some sort of specific
command you must give it to get its output in your files.
